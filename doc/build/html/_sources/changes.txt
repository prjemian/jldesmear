------------------------------------------------

Items on the TODO list:

* learn how to number this list
* switch code from [float] to numpy.ndarray or Traits Array()
* refactor lake.desmear to be a class

  * allows iterating one at a time

* refactor others in lake to be classes as well?
* update plots in the GUI
* provide ChiSqr v iteration plot (log-lin)
* add single and N iteration controls to GUI
* add write desmeared data file handling to GUI
* resolve the Traits invisible MenuBar problems seen on Ubuntu

* command line interface

  * uses same paradigm as original FORTRAN code
  * Q&A in a console session, then desmear
  * tested on Windows, Macintosh, and Linux
  * only uses standard Python libraries, no NumPy or SciPy

* All test data copied from legacy C and FORTRAN projects

* Documentation 

  * as good or better than FORTRAN manual
