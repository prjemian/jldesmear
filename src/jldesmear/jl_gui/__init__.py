'''
Simple management of user input for lake desmearing.
Uses PySide or PyQt4 (both are Qt4 support in Python), Matplotlib, and Numpy.

Basic Idea:

* select data for desmearing
* plot that data
* select desmearing range and terms (graphically, if possible, text at first)
* show effect of various terms on plot
* do desmearing on demand
* show the residuals plots in real time
* save desmeared data on demand
