About the models to test desmearing
Pete R. Jemian, 4 October 1989, Northwestern University

I have devised two models to test the demsearing program called
"Lake.FOR", written in Absoft/Microsoft FORTRAN (77) v2.2 for the
Apple Macintosh.  The program will also compile and run on the Digital
Equipment Corporation VAX computers.  Be sure to compile the program
using the G_FLOATING option ON, as in:
$ FOR/G_FLOATING LAKE

ref: J.A. Lake; ACTA CRYST 23 (1967) 191-194.

The code is written to calculate I[i], the i-th iterative improvement
to the measured intensity M using
	I[i+1] = (M / S[i]) * I[i]
where S[i] is the smeared form of I[i] and I[0] = M.  I use the
smearing equation
	S(h) = integral{ Pl(l) * I[sqrt(h*h + l*l)] * dl }
	limits: -infinity to +infinity

To avoid truncation effects in the desmearing, I fit a 1st-order power
law to the last of the data beginning at an h specified by the user.
I call this "sPower" for "start Power-law fit".  Note that the
power-law fit is only applied to extrapolate the data, not to smooth
the fit between data points!

I use a rectangular box of width 2*lo for the slit-length weighting
function Pl(l).  The definition is
	Pl(l) = { = 1/(2*lo):	|l| <= lo
		  = zero:	|l| > lo

Model #1: scattering from a sphere, file MODEL1.SMR
	(The unsmeared data is in file MODEL1.PIN for comparison.)
	I(h) = {[sin(hr)]/(hr)}^2
	r = 44 A, hMax = 0.356 1/A (to get 5 bumps)
	take 250 evenly-spaced h values
	smear this with lo = 0.2138 1/A
	create a 3rd column of error estimate as dM = M / 250
		(remember that M is the "measured" intensity)
	sPower = 0.2135 1/A
	Calculation time per iteration on the Mac SE is about 3 min.
	The peaks of this data will converge within about 5 iterations
	  but it will require at least 25 iterations to get the valleys
	  sufficiently deep.  This will also demonstrate that this
	  technique increases the scatter in the input data so don't
	  iterate excessively.
	Don't use the smoothing (set tension to 0.0).
	Don't use the alternate first guess.

Model #2: scattering from a broad distribution, file MODEL2.SMR
	I(h) = 1/[1+(hr)^4]
	r = 200 A, hMax = 0.5 1/A
	take 70 evenly-spaced (in log-coordinate) h values
	smear this with lo = 0.375 1/A
	create a 3rd column of error estimate as dM = M / 250
		(remember that M is the "measured" intensity)
	sPower = 0.225 1/A
	Calculation time per iteration on the Mac SE is about 16 sec.
	10 iterations should be sufficient to achieve convergence.
	Don't use the smoothing (set tension to 0.0).
	Don't use the alternate first guess.

=================
About the program:

The program is written to apply Lake's technique to SAS data
that was smeared by a rectangular slit-length function.  The slit-
length is defined as half the width of the slit-length function.  The
program will ask for this value.  To avoid truncation effects in the
forward smearing process, the program extrapolates data past the input
data.  To do this, the user will need to specify a starting value to
evaluate the constants for extrapolation.  This value should be within
the range of input data points or the program will not work correctly.
Also, the user will have to specify a functional form for the
extrapolation.  If the data has a constant background, use the flat
background option.  If it appears that the background obeys a linear
function, use that option.  If the background has already been removed,
perhaps it would be better to extrapolate using a power law.  For this
option, BE SURE that all the intensity is POSITIVE or a LOG OF NEGATIVE
OR ZERO error will occur.  The data extrapolation function is only used
to generate values outside the range of the input data.  No data
interpolation takes place.

There are options for smoothing the data by the technique of C.
Reinsch.  At this time, my recommendation is to never use this option.
It has been left in for historical reasons.  There is also a provision
for starting with an alternate first guess.  Don't avail yourself of
this option either as it will probably require more iterations to
achieve the desired convergence.

The number of iterations to be executed is left entirely to the user.
It may be a fixed number so that one may execute the program in BATCH
mode (on the VAX, from an indirect command file) or it may be a
variable number of iterations where the program asks after each
iteration whether or not the data should be saved.  I prefer this
method for most cases.

The format for the input file is the same as the format of the output
file.  It is three columns separated by "white space" (tabs or blanks)
by a maximum of 500 (I think) rows.  The number of rows is a constant
in a PARAMETER statement (or statements) in the program.  Change this
as needs dictate. The three columns are scattering vector, intensity,
standard error of intensity.  Fixed decimal or floating-point format
may be used interchangeably.  The output will be in floating-point with
a healthy number of digits of precision.

The screen plots are designed for a screen that is 80 columns wide by
at least 15 rows tall.  These are constants in PARAMETER statements in
each plotting subroutine and may be changed as tastes desire.  Likewise
for the plotting symbols.
