The PS120 data set
==================

The sample is nominal 640 nm polystyrene spheres 
with ~8 nm polydispersity (1.3%) as modeled using 
the Irena tool suite for IgorPro.

In this case, 120 refers to the data being collected 
in a 120 second fly scan duration.

The "ps120" data set was measured as a fly scan on the 
APS 15ID USAXS instrument in 2013-12 as part of the 
development of fly scanning capability.  The data set
has ~1500 data points and can be used as a performance test
for the desmearing.

The desmeared data file (ps120.dsm) is included 
here as an example computed from this code.
